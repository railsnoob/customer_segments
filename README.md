## Project-3 : Creating Customer Segments Using K-Means 

My submission for P-3 project for Udacity **Machine Learning NanoDegree**


Used data cleaning/pre-processing, PCA, ICA, Gaussian Mixture Models and K-Means to build customer segments for a Wholesale Distributor using customer data. We then devise a marketing plan based on this data and figure out the best way to perform A/B testing with their customers.
